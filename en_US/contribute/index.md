# Contribute to the development of Jeedom

Contributions, whether on the Core or on the Documentation, are always welcome and we do our best to process them quickly. A fault on the documentation, a passage that could be clearer, a bug on the Core ? The contributions are there for that.

Pull Requests are not always accepted, but if not we try to explain why, so that a next PR is. Jeedom is not supposed to do everything for everyone, some things are more conducive to plugins for example. The side effects of simple appearance changes can also be significant. This is why we may decide not to integrate certain requests or to do so differently.

Before developing any code on your own, we recommend discussing it on [Community](https://community.jeedom.com/), especially for new features. Other contributors and users will thus be able to better guide you, if necessary, on this modification or even warn you if others are already working on it.

### Documentation

Jeedom documentation is centralized on this site, by several mechanisms. Like the Jeedom Core, the documentation is accessible on Github and Open-Source.
