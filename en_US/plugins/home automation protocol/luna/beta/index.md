# Attention concern of Luna flashing

We received feedback on an error in flashing certain Jeedom Luna boxes. (only those shipped before 2023)
We are sorry for this and have informed our Domadoo reseller.

If you manage to connect to your Jeedom, please launch the Luna plugin (Plugins/Home automation gateway/luna) and go to :

- Recovery module update
Then do the recovery in :
- Recovery (Reset Factory)
This will update your Box completely.

If you do not have access to your box, please keep the reset button on the box pressed for more than 10 seconds; when the latter is released, the box should flash.
Let her finish the process. Jeedom should become operational again. You can do the above procedure for a complete update.

If it doesn't blink :

- Please contact Domadoo via the following link; the Domadoo team will provide you with a return label and send you a correctly flashed Luna :
