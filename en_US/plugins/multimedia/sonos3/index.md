# Sonos plugin

The Sonos plugin allows you to control the Sonos Play 1, 3, 5, Sonos Connect, Sonos Connect AMP, Sonos Playbar, Ikea Symfonisk ... It will allow you to see the state of the Sonos and to perform actions on it (play, pause, next, previous, volume, choice of a playlist…)

# Plugin configuration

The configuration is very simple, after downloading the plugin, you just need to activate it and that's it. The plugin will search for Sonos on your network and create the equipment automatically. In addition, if there is a match between Jeedom objects and Sonos rooms, Jeedom will automatically assign Sonos to the right rooms.

> **Tip**
>
> During the initial discovery it is strongly advised not to have grouped sound systems on pain of having errors

If you later add a Sonos, you can either create a Sonos device by giving Jeedom the IP or click on "Search for Sonos devices"

# TTS

TTS (text-to-speech) to Sonos requires having Windows (Samba) sharing on the network (imposed by Sonos, no way to do otherwise). So you need a NAS on the network. The configuration is quite simple you have to put the name or the ip of the NAS (be careful to put the same thing as what is declared on Sonos) and the path (relative), the user name and the password ( attention the user must have write rights)

> **Important**
>
> It is absolutely necessary to put a password for this to work

> **Important**
>
> A subdirectory is also absolutely necessary for the voice file to be correctly created.

**Here is an example of configuration (thank you @masterfion) :.**

NAS side, here is my config :

-   Jeedom folder is shared
-   Sonos user has Read / Write access (necessary for Jeedom)
-   guest user has read-only access (required for Sonos)

Sonos Plugin side, here is my config :

-   Sharing :
    -   Field 1 : 192.168.xxx.yyy
    -   Field 2 : Jeedom / TTS
-   Username : Sonos and its password…

Sonos Library side (PC app)
-   the way is : //192.168.xxx.yyy/Jeedom/TTS

> **Important**
>
> ABSOLUTELY add network sharing in the sound library, otherwise Jeedom will create the mp3 for the tts but it cannot be played by the Sonos

> **Important**
>
> Language depends on Jeedom language and uses picotts by default. As of jeedom 3.3.X it will be possible to use Google TTS to have a prettier voice


# The panel

The Sonos plugin also provides a panel that brings together all of your Sonos. Available from the Home menu → Sonos Controller :

> **Important**
>
> To have the panel you have to activate it in the plugin configuration

# FAQ

**"No devices in this collection" error when searching for equipment**
>
> This error occurs if the automatic discovery is blocked (router which blocks the boradcast for example). It does not matter you will just have to add your sonos by hand specifying the model and IP.
