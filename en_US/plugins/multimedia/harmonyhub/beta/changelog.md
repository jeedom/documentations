- Complete rewrite of the plugin
- Using the Core Dependency Installation Method
- Changed the library to communicate with the Harmony hub to use a library with better tracking
- Using a daemon to:
  - to improve the responsiveness of actions
  - to have real-time status feedback
- Simplified configuration: All that remains is to configure the hub IP address in the plugin configuration and start the daemon and the equipment will synchronize automatically with Jeedom.
- Adding a command **Start activity** which indicates the activity that is currently starting (empty if none)

This update is a major linked to the update of Logitech which reactivates the XMMP. You will have to recreate the conf file and especially activate in the Harmony application the developer mode activating the XMMP
For information, this shift intervenes the same day as the Logitech patch. Just like the workaround of 21-12-2018 which allowed many people to be repaired since it worked for everyone who was under Debian stretch (better than nothing). We did not know when Logitech was going to release support for XMMP. But blow after blow there was a reaction.

# 2018-12-21

Emergency correction related to the major of Logitech (temporary to troubleshoot, remember to relaunch the dependencies)
