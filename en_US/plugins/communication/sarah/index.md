Once you click on one of them, you get :

![sarah4](./images/sarah4.PNG)

You will find here :

-   **Name of SARAH equipment** : name of your SARAH equipment.,
-   **Parent object** : indicates the parent object to which the equipment belongs.
-   **Activate** : makes your equipment active,
-   **NodeJS address** : SARAH IP + JS node port (by default the port is 8080)
-   **TTS address** : SARAH IP + TTS server port (default port is 8888)
-   **Do not report an error if SARAH is not there** : Check if SARAH is not started continuously

Each SARAH type equipment also creates an order :

-   **Said** : Which allows in the scenarios to make say a text to Jeedom. It is possible to announce a sentence randomly by separating your sentences with a pipe : | Example : The front door is open.|A person opened the front door.|Entrance door open. Thus, during the announcement, one of its 3 sentences will be chosen at random.
-   **To play** : Which allows to execute an audio file of type .mp3 or .wav. These audio files should be placed for the **v3** : in the file **"medias"** at the root or **V4** : in the file **"customer / media"** of your SARAH application In your scenario, it will suffice to indicate the name of your audio file to be executed.

-   **Update grammar** : Which allows via a scenario, to regenerate the XML grammar from Jeedom interactions.

The button "synchronize" allows to send to SARAH the list of all interactions, it must be done each time the interactions are updated.

If you want to use the function **Ask** from SARAH, it is possible to do it from a Jeedom scenario using an action "**Do a request**".

Here is a simple example of use :

![sarah6](./images/sarah6.PNG)

When you have added the action command "**Do a request**", you will see 5 fields appear to be completed :

-   **Question** : The question you want Jeedom to ask you.
-   **Reply** : The choice of answers you want to be able to interact following the question. Each answer must be separated by a semicolon.
-   **Variable** : This will be the name of the variable in which you would like your answer to be recorded, so that you can make an evaluation for the rest of the scenario.
-   **Delay (sec)** : This is the time in seconds, before the scenario continues to perform the evaluation, if no response is given (Timeout).
-   **Commands** : Will be order "**Said**" of your SARAH equipment.

# Use case 

Examples :

-   Cela peut vous permettre de connaître toutes les remontées d'informations des différents capteurs (type “Sarah combien fait-il dehors?” ou “Sarah qu'elle est la température de la chambre”).
-   Vous pouvez également piloter les lumières (“Sarah allume la lumière du salon”), pour cela il faut bien sur avoir configuré les interactions.
-   A person presses the button on the wireless doorbell (RF433, Z-wave, etc.), Jeedom emits a sound via SARAH, announces the presence of a visitor and asks you the question, "then- I open the door ?".
-   Your washing machine is in the cellar, the program is finished, SARAH plays a "ding, dong" sound and announces that the program has ended. Then she asks you the question, "should I turn off the washing machine ?".

The only limit will be your imagination.
