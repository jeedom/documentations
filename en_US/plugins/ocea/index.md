# Plugin template

This "plugin template" serves as a basis for creating plugins for **Jeedom**.

General documentation on plugin design can be found here [here](https://doc.jeedom.com/en_US/dev/).

In detail :   
* [Using the plugin template](https://doc.jeedom.com/en_US/dev/plugin_template) : The plugin template is a plugin base for Jeedom that must be adapted with the id of your plugin and to which you just need to add your own functions.

* [Info.json file](https://doc.jeedom.com/en_US/dev/structure_info_json) : Integrated since version 3.0 from Jeedom, the file **info.json** is mandatory for the proper functioning of plugins and their proper deployment on the Jeedom Market.

* [Plugin icon](https://doc.jeedom.com/en_US/dev/Icone_de_plugin) : In order to be published on the Jeedom Market, any plugin must have an icon. Be careful not to use the same color code as the icons of the official Jeedom plugins.

* [Plugin Widget](https://doc.jeedom.com/en_US/dev/widget_plugin) : Overview of the different ways to include custom widgets in the plugin.

* [Plugin Documentation](https://doc.jeedom.com/en_US/dev/documentation_plugin) : Introducing how to set up documentation because a good plugin is nothing without proper documentation.

* [Plugin release](https://doc.jeedom.com/en_US/dev/publication_plugin) : Description of the prerequisites required for publishing the plugin.
