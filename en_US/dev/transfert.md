## Transfer your plugin

Whatever the reason, one day you may have to stop developing your plugin.In order for the community to continue using it with future versions of Jeedom, please make a request on community to find a buyer.

Once you have found it, all you have to do is contact the Jeedom team to request the transfer, 2 possibilities :
- Open a support request from your market account by choosing technical assistance -> developer (no need for a service pack or other, you just need to be identified as a developer). This request is only made from your market profiles page by clicking on the "Open a support request" button (button on the far right)
- Write an email to the dedicated address for devs or to support[a].jeedom.com with the email address registered on the dev account.
