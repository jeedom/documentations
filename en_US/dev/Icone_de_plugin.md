**Plugin icon documentation**

In order to be published on the Jeedom Market, every plugin must have an icon.

This icon will be the one displayed to users, both on the marketplace and within the Jeedom interface.

You need to produce a file in PNG format, 309 x 348 pixels.

The file name is structured as follows: `<plugin-id> _icon.png`

It must be saved in the `/plugin-info/` folder

This file is required.

We would appreciate it if you would not use the same color code as the icons of the official Jeedom plugins.

Since 2020, it is recommended to no longer put the name under the image (but be careful to keep the same model sizes) !)

Thank you for using this template (rounded edges, size, colored background, transparency around it, etc.):
