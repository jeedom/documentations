**Plugin Icon Documentation**

In order to be published on the Jeedom Market, each plugin must have an icon.

This icon will be the one displayed to users, on the market and from the Jeedom interface.

You must produce a file in png format, 309 x 348 pixels.

The file name is structured like this: `<plugin-id> _icon.png`

It should be saved in the `/plugin-info/` folder

This file is mandatory.

We thank you in advance for not using the same color code as the icons of the official Jeedom plugins.

Since 2020, it is recommended to no longer put the name under the image (be careful to keep the same sizes of the model anyway !)

Thank you for using this template (rounded edges, size, colored background, transparency around etc.):
