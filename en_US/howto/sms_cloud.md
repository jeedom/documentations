# SMS / Cloud calls

## Description

It is a paid Jeedom SAS service which allows you to send SMS and make calls (with message read by a robot) from your Jeedom.

A simple example is : if an alarm is triggered then I receive a call with a voice which indicates for example the zone where the alarm is triggered. We can do the same with an SMS.
